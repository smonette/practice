# Practice Problems
This is a repo to house small problems to keep my programming fresh after bootcamp is over.

### pigLatin.js
September 29
Create a Javascript pig latin translator. Follow these rules:
* For words that begin with consonant sounds, the initial consonant or consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word, and "ay"
* For words that begin with vowel, you just add "way" to the end.
